## R1-2-3.py</br>
The classification process was carried out according to whether the biscuits are cocoa or not and their shapes.
It also makes the process of creating the trial.csv file.</br>

## R4-5-6.py </br>
Since there is not enough data in the created trial.csv dataset (min.30 data is required, but there are 10 data), biscuits.csv was used. R6 is also requested
all results have been obtained. </br>

If more biscuit images are found, the dataset can be created and enhanced.
The system is available for this. Only the names of the images added must be numerically advanced and the maximum values of the for loops in the code must be updated.</br>

**Shape:**</br>
1 = Triangle</br>
2 = Square</br>
